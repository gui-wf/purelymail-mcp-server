      label: Current Limitation
      description: What's currently missing or difficult to achieve?
      placeholder: |

        Describe your proposed solution and how it would work from a high-level perspective.
        Include the expected conversation flow with an AI assistant.
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        1. User provides: "Create these email accounts: thomas@cool.shop, sarah@cool.shop, mike@cool.shop"
        2. Assistant uses new "Bulk Create Users" tool with array of user definitions
        3. Tool validates all inputs before starting, returns detailed success/failure report
        4. Assistant reports back with summary of created accounts and any failures

        If this involves new API integration, which PurelyMail endpoints would be involved?

        Example: 
        - Extends existing "Create User" endpoint
        - OR requires new bulk endpoint from PurelyMail
        - OR combines "Create User" + "Create App Password" operations
